<h1>WCAG 2.0</h1>

<p>On February 18, 2015 the United States Access Board released a proposed rule updating the 508 Standards and the 255 Guidelines. If the timeline for the rule to go into effect is similar to when 508 first launched, this rule should go into effect around December.</p>

<p>One of the <a href="http://www.access-board.gov/guidelines-and-standards/communications-and-it/about-the-ict-refresh/overview-of-the-proposed-rule">revisions</a> include adopting WCAG 2.0 and apply associated success criteria to websites as well as to offline electronic documents and software</p> 

<h2>What is WCAG 2.0</h2>

<p>Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), part of the Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI), is maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). It covers a wide range of recommendations for making Web content more accessible.</p>

<h2>Levels of Conformance.</h2>

<p>There are three levels of conformance: A, AA, and AAA. AA is being adopted as part of 508 refresh. A doesn't cover enough accessiblity concerns and AAA complaince is generally not recommended by W3C.</p>

<h2>ARIA</h2>

<p>WAI-ARIA, the Accessible Rich Internet Applications Suite, defines a way to make Web content and Web applications more accessible to people with disabilities. It especially helps with dynamic content and advanced user interface controls developed with Ajax, HTML, JavaScript, and related technologies.</p>
