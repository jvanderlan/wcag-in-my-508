<h2>1 Perceivable</h2>

<h2>1.1 Text Alternatives</h2>

<p><strong>1.1.1 Non-text Content:</strong> All non-text content should have a text equivalent.</p>

<h2>1.2 Time-based Media</h2>

<p><strong>1.2.1 Audio-only and Video-only (Prerecorded):</strong> Audio only content should have a transcript. If there are multiple speakers the transcript should indicate who said what. If video, there should be a text equivalent of what happens in the video.</p>

<p><strong>1.2.2 Captions (Prerecorded):</strong> Timed Captions should be provided for all important audio.</p>

<p><strong>1.2.3 Audio Description or Media Alternative (Prerecorded):</strong> Provide descriptive alternative to what's happening in video, or a media alternative.</p>

<p><strong>1.2.4 Captions (Live):</strong> Live broadcasts need to have timed text alternative of who is speaking, what they're saying and any important sounds.</p>

<p><strong>1.2.5 Audio Description (Prerecorded):</strong> Similar to 1.2.3 but audio descript must be provided, not just Media Alternative</p>

<h2>1.3 Adaptable</h2>

<p><strong>1.3.1 Info and Relationships:</strong> The structure of the DOM should allow meaningful relationships. e.g. input labels, table headers, aria roles, etc.</p>

<p><strong>1.3.2 Meaningful Sequence:</strong> The structure of the DOM and use of CSS should not interfere with the meaning of the information. Don't use css floats to change order of information.</p>

<p><strong>1.3.3 Sensory Characteristics:</strong> Instructions provided for understanding and operating content do not rely solely on sensory characteristics of components such as shape, size, visual location, orientation, or sound. "Click the round button"</p>

<h2>1.4 Distinguishable</h2>

<p><strong>1.4.1 Use of Color:</strong> Color is not used as the only visual means of conveying information, indicating an action, prompting a response, or distinguishing a visual element.</p>

<p><strong>1.4.2 Audio Control:</strong> If any audio on a Web page plays automatically for more than 3 seconds, either a mechanism is available to pause or stop the audio, or a mechanism is available to control audio volume independently from the overall system volume level.</p>

<p><strong>1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum): The visual presentation of text and images of text has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1</strong></p>

<p><strong>1.4.4 Resize text:</strong> Except for captions and images of text, text can be resized without assistive technology up to 200 percent without loss of content or functionality.</p>

<p><strong>1.4.5 Images of Text:</strong> Try not to present text as an image. Logotypes are an exception.</p>
